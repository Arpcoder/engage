               <li><strong>Fri, Nov 19, 2021</strong> - @timburks True. Despite the rise of New Power methods detailed in @jeffiel's Ask Your Developer, there are still quite a few Old Power gatekeepers. Reaching the communities that lie beyond them comes with a toll.</li>
              
         
            
                      
                         
             
               <li><strong>Fri, Nov 19, 2021</strong> - @ptevis Great question. I think, in ideal situations, that could be a role played by the retrospective or postmortem; a moment to assess completed work's performance in the larger system to apply learnings to new work. 

However, I believe these too often end up in mechanical minutia</li>
              
         
            
                      
                         
             
               <li><strong>Fri, Nov 19, 2021</strong> - Got my copy of Wednesday's Wall Street Journal. From out of the IT shop to the C-Suite.... https://t.co/TIqDWuOWI0</li>
              
         
            
                      
                         
             
               <li><strong>Fri, Nov 19, 2021</strong> - "Simultaneously improving all areas of an API ecosystem can be difficult. Focusing limited time and energy on the areas of most significant impact is a better strategy, and API ecosystem maps can help identify those areas more efficiently and effectively." https://t.co/MIxssDD7qR</li>
              
         
            
                      
                         
             
               <li><strong>Fri, Nov 19, 2021</strong> - #QOTD: "People are fairly good at short-term design, and usually awful at long-term design." - Dr. Roy Fielding</li>
              
         
            
                      
                         
             
               <li><strong>Thu, Nov 18, 2021</strong> - Why is #API Mocking Important? In this edition of Net API Notes, @wojciechbulaty not only calculates the benefits, but comes bearing spreadsheets so you can too! 

That and security, mapping API ecosystems, and more:

               <li><strong>Thu, Nov 18, 2021</strong> - "Any boundary is a useful fiction."

I've never gotten a tattoo, but this is probably the closest to coming to a permanent ethos I wouldn't look back and regret in a decade or two. ðŸ¤£ https://t.co/y1lvCi9Nbh</li>
              
         
            
                      
                         
             
               <li><strong>Wed, Nov 17, 2021</strong> - @fimbault @ruthmalan @Selmirrrrr Context is everything and talking in generalities  can get us in trouble here. However, having designed and implemented software governance systems the approach to achieving desired outcomes doesn't have to be binary.</li>
              
         
            
                      
                         
             
               <li><strong>Wed, Nov 17, 2021</strong> - I've written previously about the importance of crafting compelling stories, or "public narratives" in the course language, here: https://t.co/I19F4HHuCX

               <li><strong>Wed, Nov 17, 2021</strong> - @Selmirrrrr @ruthmalan You might say that "Microservices or Monolith architectures" is not a problem to be solved, but a polarity to be carefully balanced, similar to centralized versus federated oversight: https://t.co/DFnyDHXbYe</li>
              
         
            
                      
                         
             
               <li><strong>Wed, Nov 17, 2021</strong> - To celebrate availability of the 2nd Edition of Continuous #API Management by @dret, @mamund, @medjawii, and @mitraman, I take their 10 API pillars and ask "How Can We Map an API Ecosystem For Improved Performance?"

https://t.co/2f2LvrbIIz</li>
              
         
            
                      
                         
             
               <li><strong>Wed, Nov 17, 2021</strong> - "But there are 2 vendors that are not API gateway vendors: SmartBear and Postman, they both provide API design, documentation, mocking and testing solutions. Thatâ€™s the first crack in the Full Life Cycle API Management building weâ€™ve known for years. "

https://t.co/6S1DAK0waM</li>
              
         
            
                      
                         
             
               <li><strong>Tue, Nov 16, 2021</strong> - We know, from the 2021 State of the API report (https://t.co/bpPmD0EhEH), that a key *leadership behavior* in high-performing #API ecosystems is to clearly connect daily activity to business strategy. 

The API storytelling must powerfully relate tech to the business imperatives</li>
              
         
            
                      
                         
             
               <li><strong>Tue, Nov 16, 2021</strong> - An essential part of 'channeling' a community's efforts in pursuit of a specific outcome is providing a clear and repeatable vision. From @johncutlefish : https://t.co/XHZd1fv6wN</li>
              
         
            
                      
                         
             
               <li><strong>Tue, Nov 16, 2021</strong> - To oversimplify, Old Power is hierarchal. New power is about channeling the energy that already exists. For those that have worked a software governance role modeled in the command-n-control style and pined for communities of practice, you're familiar with the concepts. https://t.co/LbPSsjjMt6</li>
              
         
            
                      
                         
             
               <li><strong>Mon, Nov 15, 2021</strong> - Really enjoying the *free* School for Change Agents that started today: https://t.co/KchZr5RqG7

Featuring great folks, including @HelenBevanTweet, the lessons are supported with NHS-related storytelling. However, the take-aways transcend that framing and are broadly applicable</li>

               <li><strong>Fri, Nov 12, 2021</strong> - New Notes!

In this issue, API-Design First with @loriepisicchio, get into the weeds on API-First product development, and - now that we've shipped the product - delve into @CaseySoftware's dreaded "dangerous delay". Onto the notes!

                  <li><strong>Mon, Nov 08, 2021</strong> - Reflecting on #softwareGovernance this morning:

"Study an information system and neglect its standards, wires, and settings, and you miss equally essential aspects of aesthetics, justice, and change." - https://t.co/mHEmFou1Dy https://t.co/XgQOjlL48m</li>
                 
              
         
            
                      
                         
               
                  
                  <li><strong>Mon, Nov 08, 2021</strong> - "The people that feel they are API-First outperform their peers in these key, essential, business-value delivery drivers."

Excited to sit down with Erik and discuss the @getpostman 2021 State of The API Report https://t.co/HLfrxvRzui</li>
                 
              
         
            
                      
                         
               
                  
                  <li><strong>Fri, Nov 05, 2021</strong> - "-the 2021 Postman State of the API Report proved a correlation between high-performing, API-First orgs and key behaviors....we can show that healthy API ecosystems ship APIs sooner, incorporate changes more often, recover faster after outages, and require fewer hotfixes." https://t.co/nlEgjShYgg</li>
                 
              
         
            
                      
                         
               
                  
                  <li><strong>Thu, Nov 04, 2021</strong> - In the 180th Net #API Notes, I deep dive on the 2021 State of the APIs Report; specifically, *what are the four behaviors of high-performing API teams*? And how do we measure them? 

https://t.co/NUgM08DSoJ https://t.co/VghWEIPMV3</li>
                 
              
         
            
                      
                         
               
                  
                  <li><strong>Thu, Nov 04, 2021</strong> - I feel like there could be an entire book on discovering stakeholders, understanding their success criteria, and weaving a narrative of all parties' needs. @kevinswiber does a great introduction. 

Remember to emphasize the 'why' we should do API-First over the 'what'. https://t.co/3Oz8tXhriP</li>
                 
              
         
            
                      
                         
               
                  
                  <li><strong>Tue, Nov 02, 2021</strong> - Why is there no one "correct" #API lifecycle? If a lifecycle is so important, why can't we agree on the steps? Some thoughts: https://t.co/v9w99iJQJe https://t.co/Z27NxoWOCg</li>
                 
              
         
            
                      
                         
               
                  
                  <li><strong>Mon, Nov 01, 2021</strong> - I've struggled to articulate diff between API *outputs* & *outcomes*. 

"An outcome rewrites the hero of the story to be the API customers instead of the API creator. The plot is no longer about how the API gets delivered, but how the customer succeeds with it."

That resonate?</li>
                 
              
         
            
                      
                         
               
                  
                  <li><strong>Mon, Nov 01, 2021</strong> - Still reviewing lessons from @ruthmalan's organizational dynamics class the past several weeks. 

One initial "aha!" moment was the introduction of polarity maps, and how they can be used to pop the false centralized/decentralized #APIgovernance dichotomy: https://t.co/DFnyDHXbYe https://t.co/kQUWHGPelR</li>
                 
              
         
            
                      
                         
               
                  
                  <li><strong>Fri, Oct 29, 2021</strong> - The reason digital transformation efforts fail so often is that it is so much more than buying some software licenses or attending an offsite. Success requires understanding, dismantling, and rebuilding systems of power. 

Too many are poorly equipped for that work.</li>
                 
              
         
            
                      
                         
               
                  
                  <li><strong>Thu, Oct 28, 2021</strong> - With a record number of responses, the @getpostman's 2021 State of API Report is the largest looks at the API Economy to date.

                  <li><strong>Thu, Oct 21, 2021</strong> - On #API_governance:
"Throwing seeds on the ground and coming back months later expecting something to harvest isn't statistically likely. And micro-managing the interplay between the numerous participants in such a complex environment also doesn't scale." https://t.co/3NKkUdHK5r https://t.co/XUnhknnh60</li>
