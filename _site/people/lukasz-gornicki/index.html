               <li><strong>Fri, Nov 12, 2021</strong> - But don't try to be good, transparent, etc! only because you want to get better marketing.

This way it won't be authentic, you can't fake it.

You can't control side effects! 

But yeah, I know people do not like solutions that are hard to measure üòÜ https://t.co/yASfCGlXko</li>
              
         
            
                      
                         
             
               <li><strong>Fri, Nov 12, 2021</strong> - Pro tip ahead!

Don't spend your money on classical marketing. Not worth a single penny.

Spend this money on your community. Just give it back, be good, engaging, transparent, and welcome help. Just be OPEN!

Side effect? the best organic and authentic marketing ever!</li>

it is still in Draft but might be that some feedback could be already given, or you can at least subscribe to it üòÜ

                  <li><strong>Thu, Oct 28, 2021</strong> - So far one of my favorite things about these Contributor-first streams is the option that anyone can join the stream, full spontaneous experience!

@luitame thanks again for joining me and @QuetzalliAle https://t.co/b1aP1GdjxJ https://t.co/pJFH4kxT8m</li>
                 
              
         
            
                      
                         
               
                  
                  <li><strong>Wed, Oct 27, 2021</strong> - That was lots of fun as usual!

#techwriters so good stuff for you to jump into the #opensource contributions https://t.co/b1aP1GdjxJ</li>
                 
              
         
            
                      
                         
               
                  
                  <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - There can be a task there waiting for implementation for months, it is one of many things you don't have time to work on.

When you pick it up, it becomes "high priority", you expect everyone to engage and respond quickly

A habit that you need to forget about in #opensource üòÜ</li>
                 
              
         
            
                      
                         
               
                  
                  <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @relequestual I know POs that had to support 2 teams, and that is fine for some time, as budget is also important, sometimes you just need to wait for a new hire for long.

I just think scrum has a negative effect on #opensource contrib and hope trend towards #innersource will trigger changes</li>
                 
              
         
            
                      
                         
               
                  
                  <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @relequestual If it is team level and not organization level, then it is super custom, team dependent, or even specific individuals in the team. Not replicable - super custom which means super expensive</li>
                 
              
         
            
                      
                         
               
                  
                  <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @relequestual There are architects on a different level, but they are not in the team, not working with the team closely, so they are really on a different abstraction level that is hard to play all together with the team and their decisions</li>
                 
              
         
            
                      
                         
               
                  
                  <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @relequestual Why there is a PO in the scrum team that has resp for thinking about product vision but there is no clearly defined role for the same on a technical level. Then this very much depends on company/organization/experience and lots of failures on the way to get stuff done properly</li>
                 
              
         
            
                      
                         
               
                  
                  <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @relequestual And here is one of the reasons I believe it is wrong. As this is a very vague point. On one side there should be principal/senior that handles that responsibility, to have such discussions with others outside the team. Unfortunately, this is not "official role".</li>
                 
              
         
            
                      
                         
               
                  
                  <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @relequestual yes, and this "team" is empowered to make decisions. But who is it? Why not have roles in team

We have PO that take responsibility, we have SM too. In the case of team, there is no one. So they focus on the present, as they get "kudos" only for fast delivery, not smart delivery</li>
                 
              
         
            
                      
                         
               
                  
                  <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @rafaelprocha Sure, teams for platform or CI/CD setup help a lot. They do not help in the internal decisions, like "should we write our own parser or build one with the community".

There are all these roles linked to a real person, PM/PO, or Scrum Master. And then you have a "team"</li>
                 
              
         
            
                      
                         
               
                  
                  <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @relequestual My point is that there is no role that will care about it. PM/PO cares about product vision from the customer perspective.

But the strategic decision in regards to technical solutions? this is up for the team. It is very vague who should be taking care of this</li>
                 
              
         
            
                      
                         
               
                  
                  <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @rafaelprocha Yes, definitely. The thing is that as PM/PO you focus on the product from the customer perspective, and you should not influence the team on a technical level.

So who will help the team here? they are constantly under pressure to deliver and get rid of external dependencies</li>
                 
              
         
            
                      
                         
               
                  
                  <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @relequestual I mean the technical aspect only. So in case of "product future" I mean its future maintenance.

Because of the speed, you basically cancel any cooperation with folks outside scrum team, because you want to eliminate any blockers that you cannot control</li>
                 
              
         
            
                      
                         
               
                  
                  <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @relequestual but what about putting this vision in place, is there a time for it. If the vision and solution are to join OSS project for months, do you think it will be easy to justify it in the entire organization?

people combine Agile with Scrum, and they do it mainly to deliver fast</li>
                 
              
         
            
                      
                         
               
                  
                  <li><strong>Mon, Oct 25, 2021</strong> - I can't wait until the end of the week to see the rest of the submissions! https://t.co/HPnjdasevv</li>
                 
              
         
            
                      
                         
               
                  
                  <li><strong>Tue, Oct 19, 2021</strong> - open-source project != commercial product

if you come and see some feature missing, just discuss with the maintainer how to get shit done. Don't drop it and write your own from scratch.

what about #opensource sold as a commercial product? don't get me even started üòÖ</li>
                 
              
         
            
                      
                         
               
                  
                  <li><strong>Mon, Oct 18, 2021</strong> - Help us out üôè
