               <li><strong>Fri, Nov 19, 2021</strong> - Using Mermaid to render relationships between events and producers/consumers.

With this event catalog you will be able to search and view your events, and instantly see their relationships within your domain.

Everything driven my simple markdown üëç https://t.co/mdtrj62LiU</li>
              
         
            
                      
                         
             
               <li><strong>Fri, Nov 19, 2021</strong> - I'm experimenting with my NextJS application and having it as a node_module...

That's right my whole application is a npm_module.... üòÖ

This allows people to have all NextJS features, but only focus on the markdown files...

It has slightly blown my mind, but it's working! üòÖüöÄ https://t.co/43sVzkl5s9</li>

               <li><strong>Fri, Nov 19, 2021</strong> - @codeopinion Yeah I work for AsyncAPI üòÖ

But yeah you will be able to use your AsyncAPI file to render these docs.

There will be an option to build the markdown files using asyncapi file.</li>
              
         
            
                      
                         
             
               <li><strong>Thu, Nov 18, 2021</strong> - @schrepfler @apievangelist Hey, nothing concrete yet.

I'm working on packaging it together and releasing a beta version whilst I work on it to get contributors and feedback.

Hopefully something within the next week or two.</li>
              
         
            
                      
                         
             
               <li><strong>Thu, Nov 18, 2021</strong> - If you are into Event-Driven Architecture and Event Documentation checkout this tool I'm working on (WIP)

‚ö°Ô∏è Create docs in seconds
üìÑ Just add event markdown files
üìä Visual consumers, producers, and owners
üí• And more...

Hopefully, this open-source tool can help you!

Demo üëá https://t.co/NiiFUDCsSZ</li>
              
         
            
                      
                         
             
               <li><strong>Thu, Nov 18, 2021</strong> - Amazon SNS & @AsyncAPISpec right now.

               <li><strong>Thu, Nov 18, 2021</strong> - After a couple of days of spiking I'm super excited by this Event Catalog tool I'm exploring.

üí° Just focus on your event markdown files and you will be given awesome docs in return.

I got a POC working and it's awesome. I can't wait to share more.

How it works (so far) üëá https://t.co/Untrezndvj</li>
              
         
            
                      
                         
             
               <li><strong>Thu, Nov 18, 2021</strong> - Love how @AsyncAPISpec started with thoughts and problems that resonated with people.

Now people around the world collaborate, solve problems and work together to help make our ecosystem better.

Inspiring stuff for sure! üëè https://t.co/PspzesRp0q</li>
              
         
            
                      
                         
             
               <li><strong>Wed, Nov 17, 2021</strong> - Almost everything on this screen is powered by a markdown file. 

You will be able to create awesome docs for your events using simple markdown files with MDX too.

You will be able to embed Flow diagrams, Schema Editors, and more... üöÄ https://t.co/iJLp2gSFfW https://t.co/P6N4CElpHa</li>
              
         
            
                      
                         
             
               <li><strong>Wed, Nov 17, 2021</strong> - @lbroudoux @microcksio Yeah, I'm just experimenting at the moment with some patterns but it's all possible!

I will make a video soon with some initial thoughts and show an example, be great to see what you think.</li>

               <li><strong>Wed, Nov 17, 2021</strong> - Plugins can be used to take things like your @AsyncAPISpec, Kafka Topics, Amazon EventBridge Schemas and convert them into markdown required for the tool.

As it's markdown it can be versioned automatically and allow us to see historic event data etc ü§î</li>
              
         
            
                      
                         
             
               <li><strong>Tue, Nov 16, 2021</strong> - Yesterday I started to use @obsdmd and map out information about Event Architectures, Tooling and Tech.

Going to add more tech and tools over time, be interesting to see where the map ends up and how much overlap there is between everything. https://t.co/Rw38LGP59Y</li>
              
         
            
                      
                         
             
               <li><strong>Mon, Nov 15, 2021</strong> - This is spot on with the messages we send around in our systems and the importance of documentation around our event schemas.

We need to be clear on our events and their purpose, even the properties within our events.

                  <li><strong>Wed, Nov 10, 2021</strong> - An idea I'm playing around with ü§î

Imagine a tool where we could...

üåé Collaborate on events
üó£ Discuss events
‚úÖ Version events
üìä Visualise our events
‚ú® ...and more

Would this kind of tool be useful?

I built a quick demo üëá https://t.co/xZBOyqvc7c</li>
                 
              
         
            
                      
                         
               
                  
                  <li><strong>Wed, Nov 10, 2021</strong> - Event storming/Event modeling are great ways to tell a story.

We identify and arrange our events sequentially which makes it simple for us to understand.

These tools help us map our systems, but ultimately we are writing a story that we have been doing for thousands of years.</li>
                 
              
         
            
                      
                         
               
                  
                  <li><strong>Wed, Nov 10, 2021</strong> - A very interesting graph over on @EventModeling website.

Interesting to see this space evolve over time.

I still think there is some huge innovation to happen here around tooling ü§© https://t.co/QfG884slNO</li>

                  <li><strong>Fri, Oct 29, 2021</strong> - As we have WebSocket support, @smoyac came up with the idea of cross-collaboration of your files with your team.

                  <li><strong>Fri, Oct 29, 2021</strong> - Here @fmvilas shows us you can still use your editor of choice whilst getting all the benefits of our studio locally.

We use WebSockets to manage communication between files.

                  <li><strong>Fri, Oct 29, 2021</strong> - @leeerob Would love to understand more benefits and patterns using URL imports vs npm packages.

I guess one I can think of is the ability to update packages/widgets using url imports, without the need to update packages / build your website?</li>
                 
              
         
            
                      
                         
               
                  
                  <li><strong>Thu, Oct 28, 2021</strong> - For example, pick your favourite lib/tool/framework.

Just start from the top and work your way down, you will come across all sorts of patterns and wonderful (and not so wonderful) things!</li>
                 
              
         
            
                      
                         
               
                  
                  <li><strong>Thu, Oct 28, 2021</strong> - One of the best things about working with open source code full time is the amount of stuff I'm learning.

New patterns, designs, architectures, packages, and more!

                  <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - HTTP requests are a stream of events from request to response.

This is how I visualize them in my head üëá

I'm exploring building a new tool that allows us to create API's with graph nodes and streams.

Connect nodes and get a real API in return... https://t.co/XOxy3BxGkI</li>
                 
              
         
            
                      
                         
               
                  
                  <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - reduce all things.

Seriously it's my favourite function by far.

Also this visual from @codingyuri is great! https://t.co/Gjk5n0bWwD</li>
                 
              
         
            
                      
                         
               
                  
                  <li><strong>Mon, Oct 25, 2021</strong> - Over at @AsyncAPISpec @fmvilas has been playing around with Spec's first approach for building event-driven applications.

In theory, it allows us to:

‚Ä¢ Define spec 
‚Ä¢ Just focus on business logic
‚Ä¢ Profit

                  <li><strong>Fri, Oct 22, 2021</strong> - This is just an initial thought of how I think @AsyncAPISpec can help us in the Serverless world.

I believe the spec can be used to help describe and visualize our events/architecture.

Most things in AWS are event-driven. There is huge value to documenting the systems we build https://t.co/mXIc6F8eZs</li>
                 
              
         
            
                      
                         
               
                  
                  <li><strong>Thu, Oct 21, 2021</strong> - I've been playing around with flow diagrams for Event systems recently, but here is a model for HTTP.

Here is an example of an idea where you can use blocks to create mock endpoints.

Just POC but you could pipe blocks into each other...ü§î
