🙏We're going to do our best to enable and support this effort, working with our community!

🥰It's great to see the community step up and take ownership over developing critically needed JSON Schema Vocabularies!

         <li>Wed, Oct 13, 2021 - 😮Did you know, we're not an "IETF standard"?

💭We are considering self publishing new versions of JSON Schema as opposed to using IETF personal drafts.

😎This would also mean dropping the "draft" prefix from our release version identifier.
