               <li><strong>Mon, Nov 15, 2021</strong> - @RyanTablada If you want to use JSON Schema as it is today to generate databases, you‚Äôre going to have to make assumptions or add your own keywords.
We are helping enable building JSON Schema into the SQL standard itself. But that‚Äôs a long game to play! üòÖ</li>

Our slack is the free account so it is ephemeral, which is why we also use GitHub discussions.

I explain in an issue I created today, a JSON Schema file which uses the 2020-12 dialect URI in @code will be creating a false positive in terms of validation.

It will NEVER show any validation errors.
