                                 <li><strong>Thu, Nov 11, 2021</strong> - I wonder if it would be nice if we could organise our stared repositories on GitHub?

I ‚≠êÔ∏è all sorts of repositories, be nice if I could organize them into folders or something.... or leave notes on why I stared them (for future self üòÖ)

Maybe I'm just lazy ü§£</li> 
                                

                             
                        
                                 

                              
                                        
                                          

                                

                                 

                              
                                        
                                          

                                 
                                 <li><strong>Wed, Nov 10, 2021</strong> - An idea I'm playing around with ü§î

Imagine a tool where we could...

üåé Collaborate on events
üó£ Discuss events
‚úÖ Version events
üìä Visualise our events
‚ú® ...and more

Would this kind of tool be useful?

                                 <li><strong>Wed, Nov 10, 2021</strong> - Event storming/Event modeling are great ways to tell a story.

We identify and arrange our events sequentially which makes it simple for us to understand.

These tools help us map our systems, but ultimately we are writing a story that we have been doing for thousands of years.</li>

Interesting to see this space evolve over time.

               <li><strong>Mon, Oct 18, 2021</strong> - Recently we published tweets directed to women only.

We received feedback that they did not help to encourage more women to join the community, but the result was quite the opposite.

These tweets are now removed. They are also available üëáüèΩ as screenshots for reference.
