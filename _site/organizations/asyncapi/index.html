The value of transparency in @AsyncAPISpec is tackled in this article by my brilliant #OSS colleague, Barba√±o Gonz√°lez:

"History has been marked by opaque and totalitarian power systems."

                                 <li><strong>Mon, Oct 25, 2021</strong> - Looking at my GH contributions, I see a marked difference in commits vs reviews. At first, it felt SO strange to see a higher percentage under community PR reviews than created PRs (w/ new Docs). 

But I soon realized that helping as Editor and Community Builder rocks. ü•≥

I had no idea working for the #OSS #community would be SO different or that my priorities would be a 180¬∞ change from Product world.

When you pick it up, it becomes "high priority", you expect everyone to engage and respond quickly

                                 <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @relequestual Why there is a PO in the scrum team that has resp for thinking about product vision but there is no clearly defined role for the same on a technical level. Then this very much depends on company/organization/experience and lots of failures on the way to get stuff done properly</li> 
                                

                             
                        
                                 

                              
                                        
                                          

                                

                                 

                              
                                        
                                          

                                 
                                 <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @relequestual And here is one of the reasons I believe it is wrong. As this is a very vague point. On one side there should be principal/senior that handles that responsibility, to have such discussions with others outside the team. Unfortunately, this is not "official role".</li> 
                                

                             
                        
                                 

                              
                                        
                                          

                                

                                 

                              
                                        
                                          

                                 
                                 <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @relequestual yes, and this "team" is empowered to make decisions. But who is it? Why not have roles in team

We have PO that take responsibility, we have SM too. In the case of team, there is no one. So they focus on the present, as they get "kudos" only for fast delivery, not smart delivery</li> 
                                

                             
                        
                                 

                              
                                        
                                          

                                

                                 

                              
                                        
                                          

                                 
                                 <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @rafaelprocha Sure, teams for platform or CI/CD setup help a lot. They do not help in the internal decisions, like "should we write our own parser or build one with the community".

There are all these roles linked to a real person, PM/PO, or Scrum Master. And then you have a "team"</li> 
                                

                             
                        
                                 

                              
                                        
                                          

                                

                                 

                              
                                        
                                          

                                 
                                 <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @relequestual My point is that there is no role that will care about it. PM/PO cares about product vision from the customer perspective.

But the strategic decision in regards to technical solutions? this is up for the team. It is very vague who should be taking care of this</li> 
                                

                             
                        
                                 

                              
                                        
                                          

                                

                                 

                              
                                        
                                          

                                 
                                 <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @rafaelprocha Yes, definitely. The thing is that as PM/PO you focus on the product from the customer perspective, and you should not influence the team on a technical level.

So who will help the team here? they are constantly under pressure to deliver and get rid of external dependencies</li> 
                                

                             
                        
                                 

                              
                                        
                                          

                                

                                 

                              
                                        
                                          

                                 
                                 <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @relequestual I mean the technical aspect only. So in case of "product future" I mean its future maintenance.

Because of the speed, you basically cancel any cooperation with folks outside scrum team, because you want to eliminate any blockers that you cannot control</li>
