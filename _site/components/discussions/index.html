                        <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - There can be a task there waiting for implementation for months, it is one of many things you don't have time to work on.

When you pick it up, it becomes "high priority", you expect everyone to engage and respond quickly

A habit that you need to forget about in #opensource 😆</li>
                       
                    
                  
                  
                            
                               
                   
                     
                      
                                   
                        <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @relequestual I know POs that had to support 2 teams, and that is fine for some time, as budget is also important, sometimes you just need to wait for a new hire for long.

I just think scrum has a negative effect on #opensource contrib and hope trend towards #innersource will trigger changes</li>
                       
                    
                  
                  
                            
                               
                   
                     
                      
                                   
                        <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @relequestual If it is team level and not organization level, then it is super custom, team dependent, or even specific individuals in the team. Not replicable - super custom which means super expensive</li>
                       
                    
                  
                  
                            
                               
                   
                     
                      
                                   
                        <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @relequestual There are architects on a different level, but they are not in the team, not working with the team closely, so they are really on a different abstraction level that is hard to play all together with the team and their decisions</li>
                       
                    
                  
                  
                            
                               
                   
                     
                      
                                   
                        <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @relequestual Why there is a PO in the scrum team that has resp for thinking about product vision but there is no clearly defined role for the same on a technical level. Then this very much depends on company/organization/experience and lots of failures on the way to get stuff done properly</li>
                       
                    
                  
                  
                            
                               
                   
                     
                      
                                   
                        <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @relequestual And here is one of the reasons I believe it is wrong. As this is a very vague point. On one side there should be principal/senior that handles that responsibility, to have such discussions with others outside the team. Unfortunately, this is not "official role".</li>
                       
                    
                  
                  
                            
                               
                   
                     
                      
                                   
                        <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @relequestual yes, and this "team" is empowered to make decisions. But who is it? Why not have roles in team

We have PO that take responsibility, we have SM too. In the case of team, there is no one. So they focus on the present, as they get "kudos" only for fast delivery, not smart delivery</li>
                       
                    
                  
                  
                            
                               
                   
                     
                      
                                   
                        <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @rafaelprocha Sure, teams for platform or CI/CD setup help a lot. They do not help in the internal decisions, like "should we write our own parser or build one with the community".

There are all these roles linked to a real person, PM/PO, or Scrum Master. And then you have a "team"</li>
                       
                    
                  
                  
                            
                               
                   
                     
                      
                                   
                        <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @relequestual My point is that there is no role that will care about it. PM/PO cares about product vision from the customer perspective.

But the strategic decision in regards to technical solutions? this is up for the team. It is very vague who should be taking care of this</li>
                       
                    
                  
                  
                            
                               
                   
                     
                      
                                   
                        <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @rafaelprocha Yes, definitely. The thing is that as PM/PO you focus on the product from the customer perspective, and you should not influence the team on a technical level.

So who will help the team here? they are constantly under pressure to deliver and get rid of external dependencies</li>
                       
                    
                  
                  
                            
                               
                   
                     
                      
                                   
                        <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @relequestual I mean the technical aspect only. So in case of "product future" I mean its future maintenance.

Because of the speed, you basically cancel any cooperation with folks outside scrum team, because you want to eliminate any blockers that you cannot control</li>
                       
                    
                  
                  
                            
                               
                   
                     
                      
                                   
                        <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @relequestual but what about putting this vision in place, is there a time for it. If the vision and solution are to join OSS project for months, do you think it will be easy to justify it in the entire organization?

people combine Agile with Scrum, and they do it mainly to deliver fast</li>

I believe the spec can be used to help describe and visualize our events/architecture.

Most things in AWS are event-driven. There is huge value to documenting the systems we build https://t.co/mXIc6F8eZs</li>

Here is an example of an idea where you can use blocks to create mock endpoints.

Just POC but you could pipe blocks into each other...🤔

- help us tweet together https://t.co/CD3zYADfNa
- join the ongoing discussion here https://t.co/6JZbZgBHot

I (@derberq) apologize for current mistakes and encourage you to continue giving us feedback on how we can do better</li>
                          
                       
                    
                 
                  
                            
                               
                     
                       
                        
                         
                                          
                           <li><strong>Mon, Oct 18, 2021</strong> - Recently we published tweets directed to women only.

We received feedback that they did not help to encourage more women to join the community, but the result was quite the opposite.

These tweets are now removed. They are also available 👇🏽 as screenshots for reference.

This year’s #AsyncAPI Conference is coming up, but we’ve only received CfPs from men so far.
