The issue is in the backlog, but that doesn't mean it has any priorty, and isn't scheduled work.

Let's see if we can change that!?</li>
                       
                    
                  
                  
                            
                               
                   
                     
                      
                                   
                        <li><strong>Fri, Nov 12, 2021</strong> - The Pull Request I've created will introduce the same warning for any JOSN document which identifies as using the 2020-12 dialect (JSON Schema draft 2020-12).
https://t.co/KQmxPnNz4R
It's unexciting, but could potentially save a lot of false assurance and debugging time! 🥳</li>
                       
                    
                  
                  
                            
                               
                   
                     
                      
                       
                    
                  
                  
                            
                               
                   
                     
                      
                                   
                        <li><strong>Fri, Nov 12, 2021</strong> - In JSON Schema, unknown keywords are ignored.
I explain in an issue I created today, a JSON Schema file which uses the 2020-12 dialect URI in @code will be creating a false positive in terms of validation.

It will NEVER show any validation errors.

I made a PR to fix the error message around the same time: https://t.co/ukrJma2ZsZ

But, right now, there's no such warning for draft 2020-12, so what's happening?</li>
                       
                    
                  
                  
                            
                               
                   
                     
                      
                                   
                        <li><strong>Fri, Nov 12, 2021</strong> - You might notice that in the previous images, JSON Schema draft-07 was used. This is the latest version of JSON Schema @code supports.

When someone tries to use draft 2019-09, they get a warning against the `$schema` value, stating that it's not supported. https://t.co/TdlZiulVTw</li>
                       
                    
                  
                  
                            
                               
                   
                     
                      
                                   
                        <li><strong>Fri, Nov 12, 2021</strong> - ...you get autocomplete and validation. This is pretty neat for authoring JSON Schemas. It's also automatically applied to files at specific locations using https://t.co/fLlcUqSAZ8

It stops you making potentially silly mistakes.

                        <li><strong>Fri, Nov 12, 2021</strong> - In a recent post, someone asked about Visual Studio support for newer versions of JSON Schema. A later comment included the quote in the first part of this thread (https://t.co/hlrE2MfwTQ)

                        <li><strong>Fri, Nov 12, 2021</strong> - Drafts? 
JSON Schema is released as "drafts" from version 1-7, then proceeding with 2019-09 and 2020-12.

@code?
VSCode allows for validation of JSON Schema baked in.
That's the mechansium through which you get autocomplete/intelisense AND validation in your config files 😎</li>

                           <li><strong>Wed, Oct 13, 2021</strong> - 😮Did you know, we're not an "IETF standard"?

💭We are considering self publishing new versions of JSON Schema as opposed to using IETF personal drafts.

😎This would also mean dropping the "draft" prefix from our release version identifier.
