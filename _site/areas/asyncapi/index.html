#techwriters so good stuff for you to jump into the #opensource contributions https://t.co/b1aP1GdjxJ</li>
                          
                       
                    
                 
                  
                            
                               
                     
                       
                        
                         
                                          
                           <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - There can be a task there waiting for implementation for months, it is one of many things you don't have time to work on.

When you pick it up, it becomes "high priority", you expect everyone to engage and respond quickly

A habit that you need to forget about in #opensource 😆</li>
                          
                       
                    
                 
                  
                            
                               
                     
                       
                        
                         
                                          
                           <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @relequestual I know POs that had to support 2 teams, and that is fine for some time, as budget is also important, sometimes you just need to wait for a new hire for long.

I just think scrum has a negative effect on #opensource contrib and hope trend towards #innersource will trigger changes</li>
                          
                       
                    
                 
                  
                            
                               
                     
                       
                        
                         
                                          
                           <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @relequestual If it is team level and not organization level, then it is super custom, team dependent, or even specific individuals in the team. Not replicable - super custom which means super expensive</li>
                          
                       
                    
                 
                  
                            
                               
                     
                       
                        
                         
                                          
                           <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @relequestual There are architects on a different level, but they are not in the team, not working with the team closely, so they are really on a different abstraction level that is hard to play all together with the team and their decisions</li>
                          
                       
                    
                 
                  
                            
                               
                     
                       
                        
                         
                                          
                           <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @relequestual Why there is a PO in the scrum team that has resp for thinking about product vision but there is no clearly defined role for the same on a technical level. Then this very much depends on company/organization/experience and lots of failures on the way to get stuff done properly</li>
                          
                       
                    
                 
                  
                            
                               
                     
                       
                        
                         
                                          
                           <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @relequestual And here is one of the reasons I believe it is wrong. As this is a very vague point. On one side there should be principal/senior that handles that responsibility, to have such discussions with others outside the team. Unfortunately, this is not "official role".</li>
                          
                       
                    
                 
                  
                            
                               
                     
                       
                        
                         
                                          
                           <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @relequestual yes, and this "team" is empowered to make decisions. But who is it? Why not have roles in team

We have PO that take responsibility, we have SM too. In the case of team, there is no one. So they focus on the present, as they get "kudos" only for fast delivery, not smart delivery</li>
                          
                       
                    
                 
                  
                            
                               
                     
                       
                        
                         
                                          
                           <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @rafaelprocha Sure, teams for platform or CI/CD setup help a lot. They do not help in the internal decisions, like "should we write our own parser or build one with the community".

There are all these roles linked to a real person, PM/PO, or Scrum Master. And then you have a "team"</li>
                          
                       
                    
                 
                  
                            
                               
                     
                       
                        
                         
                                          
                           <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @relequestual My point is that there is no role that will care about it. PM/PO cares about product vision from the customer perspective.

But the strategic decision in regards to technical solutions? this is up for the team. It is very vague who should be taking care of this</li>
                          
                       
                    
                 
                  
                            
                               
                     
                       
                        
                         
                          
                       
                    
                 
                  
                            
                               
                     
                       
                        
                         
                                          
                           <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @relequestual I mean the technical aspect only. So in case of "product future" I mean its future maintenance.

Because of the speed, you basically cancel any cooperation with folks outside scrum team, because you want to eliminate any blockers that you cannot control</li>
                          
                       
                    
                 
                  
                            
                               
                     
                       
                        
                         
                                          
                           <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @relequestual but what about putting this vision in place, is there a time for it. If the vision and solution are to join OSS project for months, do you think it will be easy to justify it in the entire organization?

people combine Agile with Scrum, and they do it mainly to deliver fast</li>

if you come and see some feature missing, just discuss with the maintainer how to get shit done. Don't drop it and write your own from scratch.

If you have no idea what @AsyncAPISpec is, this stuff can hopefully help and help you explore different protocols and real-world examples. https://t.co/LrQkBq8C5v</li>
                          
                       
                    
                 
                  
                            
                               
                     
                       
                        
                         
                                          
                           <li><strong>Fri, Oct 29, 2021</strong> - As we have WebSocket support, @smoyac came up with the idea of cross-collaboration of your files with your team.

Imagine editing files together in real-time and seeing these changes in the studio 😍 https://t.co/qTIIlkJ2tD</li>
                          
                       
                    
                 
                  
                            
                               
                     
                       
                        
                         
                                          
                           <li><strong>Fri, Oct 29, 2021</strong> - Here @fmvilas shows us you can still use your editor of choice whilst getting all the benefits of our studio locally.

We use WebSockets to manage communication between files.

                           <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - HTTP requests are a stream of events from request to response.

This is how I visualize them in my head 👇

I'm exploring building a new tool that allows us to create API's with graph nodes and streams.

Connect nodes and get a real API in return... https://t.co/XOxy3BxGkI</li>
                          
                       
                    
                 
                  
                            
                               
                     
                       
                        
                         
                                          
                           <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - reduce all things.

Seriously it's my favourite function by far.

Also this visual from @codingyuri is great! https://t.co/Gjk5n0bWwD</li>
                          
                       
                    
                 
                  
                            
                               
                     
                       
                        
                         
                          
                       
                    
                 
                  
                            
                               
                     
                       
                        
                         
                                          
                           <li><strong>Fri, Oct 22, 2021</strong> - This is just an initial thought of how I think @AsyncAPISpec can help us in the Serverless world.

I believe the spec can be used to help describe and visualize our events/architecture.

Most things in AWS are event-driven. There is huge value to documenting the systems we build https://t.co/mXIc6F8eZs</li>
                          
                       
                    
                 
                  
                            
                               
                     
                       
                        
                         
                                          
                           <li><strong>Thu, Oct 21, 2021</strong> - I've been playing around with flow diagrams for Event systems recently, but here is a model for HTTP.

Here is an example of an idea where you can use blocks to create mock endpoints.

Just POC but you could pipe blocks into each other...🤔

Just a thought 🤣 https://t.co/rlIOpL0Or7</li>
