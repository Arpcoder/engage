As it's markdown it can be versioned automatically and allow us to see historic event data etc ü§î</li>

Going to add more tech and tools over time, be interesting to see where the map ends up and how much overlap there is between everything. https://t.co/Rw38LGP59Y</li>

We need to be clear on our events and their purpose, even the properties within our events.

When you pick it up, it becomes "high priority", you expect everyone to engage and respond quickly

A habit that you need to forget about in #opensource üòÜ</li>

I just think scrum has a negative effect on #opensource contrib and hope trend towards #innersource will trigger changes</li>

                           <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @relequestual Why there is a PO in the scrum team that has resp for thinking about product vision but there is no clearly defined role for the same on a technical level. Then this very much depends on company/organization/experience and lots of failures on the way to get stuff done properly</li>
                          
                       
                    
                 
                  
                            
                               
                     
                       
                        
                         
                                          
                           <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @relequestual And here is one of the reasons I believe it is wrong. As this is a very vague point. On one side there should be principal/senior that handles that responsibility, to have such discussions with others outside the team. Unfortunately, this is not "official role".</li>
                          
                       
                    
                 
                  
                            
                               
                     
                       
                        
                         
                                          
                           <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @relequestual yes, and this "team" is empowered to make decisions. But who is it? Why not have roles in team

We have PO that take responsibility, we have SM too. In the case of team, there is no one. So they focus on the present, as they get "kudos" only for fast delivery, not smart delivery</li>
                          
                       
                    
                 
                  
                            
                               
                     
                       
                        
                         
                                          
                           <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @rafaelprocha Sure, teams for platform or CI/CD setup help a lot. They do not help in the internal decisions, like "should we write our own parser or build one with the community".

There are all these roles linked to a real person, PM/PO, or Scrum Master. And then you have a "team"</li>
                          
                       
                    
                 
                  
                            
                               
                     
                       
                        
                         
                                          
                           <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @relequestual My point is that there is no role that will care about it. PM/PO cares about product vision from the customer perspective.

But the strategic decision in regards to technical solutions? this is up for the team. It is very vague who should be taking care of this</li>
                          
                       
                    
                 
                  
                            
                               
                     
                       
                        
                         
                          
                       
                    
                 
                  
                            
                               
                     
                       
                        
                         
                                          
                           <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - @relequestual I mean the technical aspect only. So in case of "product future" I mean its future maintenance.

Because of the speed, you basically cancel any cooperation with folks outside scrum team, because you want to eliminate any blockers that you cannot control</li>

This is how I visualize them in my head üëá

I'm exploring building a new tool that allows us to create API's with graph nodes and streams.

Connect nodes and get a real API in return... https://t.co/XOxy3BxGkI</li>
                          
                       
                    
                 
                  
                            
                               
                     
                       
                        
                         
                                          
                           <li><strong>Tue, Oct 26, 2021</strong> - reduce all things.

Seriously it's my favourite function by far.

Also this visual from @codingyuri is great! https://t.co/Gjk5n0bWwD</li>
                          
                       
                    
                 
                  
                            
                               
                     
                       
                        
                         
                          
                       
                    
                 
                  
                            
                               
                     
                       
                        
                         
                                          
                           <li><strong>Fri, Oct 22, 2021</strong> - This is just an initial thought of how I think @AsyncAPISpec can help us in the Serverless world.

I believe the spec can be used to help describe and visualize our events/architecture.

Most things in AWS are event-driven. There is huge value to documenting the systems we build https://t.co/mXIc6F8eZs</li>
                          
                       
                    
                 
                  
                            
                               
                     
                       
                        
                         
                                          
                           <li><strong>Thu, Oct 21, 2021</strong> - I've been playing around with flow diagrams for Event systems recently, but here is a model for HTTP.

Here is an example of an idea where you can use blocks to create mock endpoints.

Just POC but you could pipe blocks into each other...ü§î
